**Background:** We have too many objects to display in one list. We want to group them
automatically into folders to provide a birdâ€™s eye view / summary of the object names that are
available.

**Exercise 1:** Given a list of strings, find a way to group them based on their prefixes. The group
names should be the first item that belongs to the group.
Input: list of strings.
Output: json object where the key is the name of the group and the value is the list of elements
within the group.

**Exercise 2:** Write a React app that displays the result in a folder structure. Allow the user to be
able to create new folders and move each name into different folders.
